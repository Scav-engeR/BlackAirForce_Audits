US Government Agencies: Blacklist compiled by SquidBlacklist.org on 2/28/2013
?a?as?e??, ?a?t??? 01, 2013 | ??a?t????e ap??| | 

# DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, SUPREME COURT, CONGRESS, US MILITARY, LAW ENFORCEMENT, CIA, FBI, DHS, DEA, ATF, FEMA, #
# NASA, EPA, NSA, US AIRFORCE, US ARMY, US NAVY, NATO, CDC, CONTRACTORS, PENTAGON, US MARSHALS, #
# and others.... #
# #
# Our USG blacklist is directed towards users and administrators who wish to block unwanted communications # 
# with United States government networks, intelligence
agencies, military networks, and law enforcement #
# agencies. It does not include networks that host useful sites such as the social security administration, #
# the us postal service, or your local unemployment office website. This list is not intended to block non #
# threatening, government service type websites that we all use. But it is designed to block the US Government #
# networks that you likely, really do not want traffic from your network reaching. It is a simple CIDR #
# formatted list, so you could use it for your firewall rules just as easily as you could for a squid acl. #
# #
# No other public source has published a more thorough list of US Government ip ranges, undoubtedly there #
# are many more undiscovered networks that are not yet known and thus, not included in our list, However, # 
# it is the most complete list of USG ranges publicly available, and we update it regularly. #
# #
# #
# ---------This list is intended for legitimate network security uses only--------- #
# #
# If you have additions or ammendments that should be made to this list, email us at submit@squidblacklist.org #
